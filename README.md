# Crypto_Clustering

## Overview of Project

### Martha and I were tasked with helping Accountability Accounting enter the complex and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency. Our goal was to create a classification system that would inform the company's new cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

### To accomplish this, we used unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the vast amount of available data. We first processed the data to fit machine learning models, and then utilized a clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies based on similarities.

### To visualize our findings, we created interactive data visualizations that allowed us to communicate our results effectively to the board. Additionally, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to reduce the complexity of the data and make it easier to analyze.

### Our work ultimately helped our client make informed investment decisions, diversify their portfolio, and better understand the cryptocurrency market. Through this project, we were able to leverage our skills in unsupervised learning to solve a real-world problem for our client.
